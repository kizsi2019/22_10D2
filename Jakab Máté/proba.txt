NICHOLAS: Michael Morbius completed his doctorate by 19 and quickly established himself as the world’s leading authority on blood-borne diseases.

Michael Morbius, please step forward to acknowledge the receipt of your prize from His Majesty, the King of Sweden.

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]

[TRUMPETERS PLAY FANFARE]

The king and the queen, their loyal subjects, all of Scandinavia and the entire scientific community.

Well, Anna, we both know I have issues.

But, hey, I kept the program.

[TONE SOUNDS, THEN WOMAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER PA]

Hey, Dr. Bancroft.

Michael.

Uh, yes?

You got a minute?

MARTINE: “I can’t accept a prize for the by-product of a failed experiment.”

It would help if you stuck around long enough to cash them.

[SIGHS]

Does our generous benefactor, Milo, know what you’re actually doing here?

What am I actually doing here?

No bells ringing. Uh…

Okay. Maybe this will jog your memory.

MICHAEL: I wouldn’t go in there if I were you.

That is a…

It’s a fish tank.

Hmm.

Oh, I see.

Some friends I brought back from Costa Rica.

So when were you gonna tell me?

More importantly, how did you get my pass code?

It’s the first six digits of pi backwards.

It’s your password for everything.

You should change that.

You could lose your license for this.

I’m not gonna need it much longer, doctor.

You, on the other hand, will.

You know, there’s something called “plausible deniability.”

You should be thanking me.

These are the only mammals on Earth that have evolved to feed exclusively on blood.

So in order to drink it, these bats produce saliva that contains unique anticoagulants.

So your theory is, if you can successfully splice vampire genes into your DNA, it would allow your body to produce those same anticoagulants.

MICHAEL: Yes.

It would be a cure.

At what cost?

The fusion of different species is a legacy we already carry in our bodies.

Viruses insinuating their nucleic acid onto our own over hundreds of thousands of years.

That’s evolution. This is different.

I don’t think it is.

We have to push the boundaries, take the risks.

Without that, there is no science.

No medicine.

Dr. Bancroft? She is, uh, overqualified, outperforming, brilliant as usual.

And a royal pain in my ass.

But she’s keeping me honest for the most part. Why do you ask?

Eh, no reason. Just haven’t seen you in forever.

I wondered if she had something to do with it.

Aw, I miss you too.

But, yes, she has been working with me to save our lives.

I could ask her to stop if you like, put us out of our misery.

Just don’t do something stupid and go and fall in love because, believe you me, there is absolutely no cure for that.

Says the guy who knows absolutely nothing about the subject.

Not true.

I read about it in books all the time.

Books, really? Wow.

Yeah.

Or romantic comedies. The point is…

The point is, love is not on the cards for us, my friend.

I killed the nurse.

I know. But you know what it’s like your first time.

You have no idea what you’re doing. You have no control.

No.

Milo, you have to stop.

You have to stop. You have to stop denying who you are.

It’s boring. We can go anywhere, we can do anything. Let’s go.

Let’s have some fun.

This isn’t you.

I know you. Where’s the brother that I used to have?

How can you say that to me?

Look what you’ve become.

Everything I am, I am because of you.

I looked up to you my whole life.

I will never leave you, and I will not go back.

Artificial blood will keep us stable until I do.

I wanted to be there.

Well, then apology rescinded.

I guess we’re both a little crazy.

How do you feel?

Incredible.

I mean, I went from dying my entire life to feeling more alive than ever.

Thankfully, artificial blood keeps me stable.

I just have to drink it more often.

How often?

Uh…

Every four hours, 22 minutes. Down from six.

It’s losing its effectiveness.

The issue is, when it stops working… I’ll become like Milo.

You won’t.

Well, it’s Michael.

I’m worried about him.

He’s alone out there.

And I think he needs me.

If I can get to him before the police do, I can help him.

You wouldn’t happen to know where he is, would you?

You two have always been so close.

I’m sorry.

I don’t.

Hmm.

[HEART BEATING RAPIDLY]

Just to be sure, I’m going to ask you one more time.

You don’t happen to know where he is, do you, Martine?

I wouldn’t lie to you, Milo.

I don’t.

Now, if you don’t mind, I have work to do.

Okay.

Well, if you see him, if you hear from him, tell him: “We are the few against the many.”

We’ll have to do that dinner another time, Martine.

CCTV.

I’ll go grab the footage.

I don’t want you to have to move or anything.

All right, check this out.

Wait, wait, wait.

That’s not the doctor.

RODRIGUEZ: It’s what these bloodsuckers do. They multiply.

Breaking news on the Lower East Side where three people have been killed.

Authorities have confirmed the discovery of three new bodies outside a bar popular with Wall Street traders.

And like the victims before them, they were completely drained of their blood, earning the killer the moniker “Vampire Murderer.”

The prime suspect, renowned scientist Dr. Michael Morbius, remains at large.

What have you got yourself into?

However, another source inside the department has told us that CCTV footage of the murders suggests the killer could be a copycat.

Residents are being urged to stay home after sundown until the killer, or killers, are brought to justice.

I’ve been more than a friend to you all this time, Milo.

And I’m going to stay here with you.

But there will be no more violence, understand?

That doesn’t do it for me.

I should have known. You always take his side.

Tell me your side, then, Milo.

Michael doesn’t accept what he is, Nicholas.

I’m gonna make him accept it.

See? There! There you are!

Perfect Michael, selfless Michael, Michael the favorite!

Don’t be childish, Milo!

If anyone has a claim to being my favorite, it’s you.

I’ve devoted my life to you.

You pitied me before.

You did. You pitied me before. You’re repulsed by me now.

I am repulsed… by what you’ve done, by what you’ve become.
